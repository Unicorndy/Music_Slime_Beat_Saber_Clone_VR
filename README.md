# Music Slime Beat Saber Clone VR
A clone Oculus VR Beat Saber Game for my personal project. (Title: Slime Music Beat)

My learning experience of Unity started 4 months ago, and by gathering free tools online, I am able to create this game within one day. Listed below are the youtube videos I followed to create the majority of the game. The rest of the scripts, animations and etc are based on my 4 months learning experience to glue them together. 

Game Mechanic based on tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh4k0Q1Pl7E (MAKING BEAT SABER IN 10 MIN - Unity Challenge)
Audio Visualization based on tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Av788P9stk (Audio Visualization - Unity/C# Tutorial [Part 1 - FFT/Spectrum Theory])
